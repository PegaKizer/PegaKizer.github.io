        Welcome to the Basketball page. Here we will learn both 
        the rules and history of basketball. And who is the best.

    <h2>
        History. Basketball is one of the most popular sports here in the United states, however even though its one of the most known and pkayed not
        many people know the history behind it. The story begins in 1891 when a canadian physical educator in Massachusetts, wanted to have a sport to play that fun was fun 
        like football but not nearly as dangerous. And so he created basketball.

    <h3>
        Best player of all time. I would like to state that this part of the page is entirly oppinionated and you can disagree with me. 
        I feel that Lebron James is the greatest basketball player of all time due to his increadible athletisim and his unwavering determination. Aswell as he is 6 foot 9 inches tall allowing
        Lebron to dominate on the court.

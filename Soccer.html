        History. Football(soccer) is a game that countless people love world wide, yet one must wonder when was soccer created? Now the answer to that 
        question is fairly simple. Merly 2,000 years ago several different cultures had their own version of the game. These cultures are Mexico, China, Italy and France.
        Yet the soccer we know and love today was founded in England in 1863 where they formed the Football association.

        Famous players. Over the years their have been countless incredible athleats who have played soccer yet a few have really stood out.
        Such as Messi. Lionel Messi is regarded as one of the greatest soccer players of all times along side Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar. The three of
        them have dominated the sport. In my opinion Messi is the greatest of all time due to his ball handling skills, teamwork and dedication.

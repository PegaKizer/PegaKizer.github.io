    and famous Tennis athleats.

 <h2>
    Origin.
    Tennis originated along the Mediterranean coast, first played by the French and Italians.
    Tennis gained popularity in the 11th century when French monks played the sport as 
    pastime. Even though tennis was invented back in the 11th century the rules we 
    know today codeified in 1874. The French gave the sport the name tennis as it deprives 
    from the french word tenir, the direct translation means to hold.
Rules.
To win a point, a player must hit a shot either before the ball has bounced or after the first bounce. 
If the ball bounces twice, then the player with the last shot wins the point. A player must also 
wait for the ball to pass the net and come over to his side of the court and cannot step over the
 net to hit the ball.

<h3>
    The best players.
    This part of the page is entirly opinionated, but In my opinion the best
    player is Rafael The reason as to why I feel this way
    Is because Rafael Nadal over the years has had to overcome countelss 
    trials and tribulations inorder to get the where he is now. And even in his old yeaers he still has remained incredible.
